# Algorithm Notes
- I would like to keep this place for me to put algorithms commonly tested on interviews. These are either things I know or I need more practice.
- Currently I'll be more focusing on harder algorithms. [02/04/2025] My current priorities are z-algorithm, KMP, and graph-related algorithms.
- For more average interview-level (easy-medium) algorithms, I highly recommend you to check out https://github.com/changgyhub/leetcode_101
### Happy Algorithms!
